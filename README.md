- Teleports allays to the their owner if they are 64 blocks away from them, unless nametaged
- Allays trapped in or above walls, fences, fence gates, composters, (filled) cauldrons and hoppers don't teleport ever
- Teleports allays to their note block if they are outside the 16Â m range and their timer runs out, unless nametaged
  - handy in watery environments where allays are slower
  - has suffocation protection by teleporting them on top of the note block (there is always air above working note blocks)
  - has the following leash functionality to counter this note block feature
- leashed allays cannot like note blocks and thus follow the player
- naming an allay "unname" causes it to lose its custom name
- /trigger invulnerable_allays  makes your allays immortal
  - trigger again to make them mortal again

If server owners don't want immortal allays, then go into the data pack file > data > tpallays >  functions and remove invulnerable.mcfunction
